### Pseudo-Sibylline oracles

Pseudo-Sibylline oracles<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Sibylline oracles" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibylline_Oracles" -->
contain hexametric poems written in Ancient Greek. These *oracula* were mainly
composed in 150BC - 700AD to twelve distinct extant books. They were circulating
and quite famous among the Judaeo-Christian community at that time.

They shouldn't, however, be too much confused with the earlier
Sibylline books<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Sibylline books" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibylline_Books" -->.
Sibylline books contained religious ceremonial advice that were consulted by
the selected priests and curators in the Roman state when it was in deep
political trouble. The collection of the original Sibylline books were destroyed
by different accidental events and deliberate actions in history.

Pseudo-Sibylline oracles, on the other hand, contain Jewish narrative of the
human history contrasted with the Greek mythology and to the chronology of the
other great ancient empires. Another intention of the oracles was to support
evolving Christian doctrine and interpretation of the prophecies. Prophecies
were mostly grounded in Jewish tradition, but surprisingly some pagan world
events also came to be interpreted as signs of the coming Messiah. Sibyl, the
acclaimed author of the prophecies as a woman prophetess, the daughter of Noah
in the Pseudo-Sibylline lore, has a unique character crossing over the common
borders in several ancient religions and mythology.

Good introductions to the Pseudo-Sibylline oracles can be found from these two
books:

* Sibylline Oracles in "The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Volume I"<!-- cite author="J. J. Collins" title="Sibylline Oracles in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Volume I" date="2011" location="Pages 317-472" type="book" href="https://books.google.fi/books?id=TNdeolWctsQC" --> by J. J. Collins

### Focus of the study

Some material in the Pseudo-Sibylline oracles contains cryptic puzzles,
referring to persons, cities, countries, and epithets of God for example. These
secretive references are often very general in nature, pointing only to the
first letter of the subject and its numerical value. Solving them requires, not
so much of mathematical or cryptographical skills in a modern sense, but a proper
knowledge of the context, both inner textual and historical context.

Most of the alphanumeric riddles in the oracles can already be taken as solved
by various researchers. But, some of the riddles are still problematic and open
for better proposals. Better yet, few of these open riddles are more complex and
specific enough so that one may try to solve them by modern programmable tools.

As an independent researcher not associated or affiliated with any organization,
the sole motivation and purpose of mine in the chapters is to provide a reusable
and a testable method for processing and analyzing ancient corpora, especially
detecting alphanumeric patterns in text. Although the target language in this
study is Ancient Greek, the method should be applicable to any language using
alphabetic numerals.
